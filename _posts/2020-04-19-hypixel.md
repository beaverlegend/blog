There are many types of hypixel games, These include bedwars, skywars, skyblock, warlords, UHC Champions, crazy walls, quakecraft, cops and crims, smash heros, murder mystery, speed UHC, TNT games, housing, arcade games, Duels, Blitz survival games, build battle, mega walls, and smash heros.

BEDWARS!


In Bed Wars, you and up to 4 teammates spawn on islands. You must gather 4 resources: Iron, Gold, Diamonds and Emeralds to buy items and upgrades at the Shopkeepers on your island.

Each island has a Bed - if your Bed is destroyed you can no longer respawn. Place blocks around your bed to defend it from being destroyed. Destroy other teams' beds then kill them to win!

SKYWARS!	
Our take on the Skywars gamemode - featuring the Angel of Death. Each player/team spawns on its own island and the aim is to be the last player or team alive. Kill players using a weapon or knock them off. With each kill you will be rewarded with a soul. You can use souls to unlock many kits and perks to improve your game experience.
